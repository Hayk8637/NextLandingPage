      "answer": "Our digital QR code menu is contactless and it’s always \"on the table\". Guests don’t have to wait for the waiter to bring them a menu or search for the menu on their own. The less waiting time and actions needed to make an order, the more orders will be made.\n\nPaper menus can’t be edited, there is no way to create promotions and discounts quickly.\n\nTo maintain the relevance and presentable look of a paper menu, it has to be reprinted from time to time.",
      "question": " I already have menus made of paper, why is your digital menu better? "

      "answer": "The PDF file is not interactive. It inherits all the disadvantages of a paper menu. Your QR code menu looks like a text based price list, and not like a modern store page that is made to increase your sales.  You cannot add photos and descriptions for every item to the PDF menu, it will immediately become huge and unreadable.  When you scan QR code of a PDF menu, you need to download it to your phone, which can be problematic with low Internet connection speed or if your guests just don't like to download anything to their phones.  PDF menus, once again, cannot be quickly edited. You have a new type of cheesecake? Now you have to redo the entire PDF and re-upload it to your hosting. In our digital menu, a similar operation takes 20 seconds and is easily performed even with your Android or iPhone.",
      "question": " I already have a QR code menu with a PDF file, how is your digital menu different from this? "
